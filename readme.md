## PROBLEMS

#### Finding Peers
* Heres a problem: we want to download a file with BitTorrent, but its a peer-to-peer protocol and we have no idea where to find peers to download it from.
* This is a lot like moving to a new city and trying to make friendsâ€”maybe well hit up a local pub or a meetup group! Centralized locations like these are the big idea behind trackers, which are central servers that introduce peers to each other. Theyre just web servers running over HTTP
* Decentralized Peer Discovery DHT, PEX, and magnet links.
